# Python PW Generator
A simple PW genrator written with python

As someone who is just learning python, my projects will start very small and simple and with time become more complex. This first project was a simple password generator where one can select how many password combinations and charachters (Upper/Lower case, numbers and special characters) they wish to include in their pw combinations. 

If you see anything wrong please inform me as I am new to this and need all the help I can get!
